# Peptide_Charge_Prediction
Multiclass Classification Algorithm to predict peptide fragment charge states:

For my final project in my Machine Learning for Neural and Biological Data course, I built an algorithm to predict the ionic charge states (+1, +2.... +n) of peptide fragments generated when passed through a Mass Spectrometer. To train the model I used data from _A high-throughput approach reveals distinct peptide charging behaviors in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry_ by Xu et al.
